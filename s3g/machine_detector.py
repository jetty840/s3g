"""
A Machine Detector that can detect machines we would like
to connect to.  Can detect multiple machines by passing
in a list of machine names.  We search through their machine
profiles for their VID/PID information, use makerbot's pyserial
library to find any/all ports with those values, and compare iSerial
values to find all current, added and removed ports.  All ports
are kept track of in a python dict named "ports".
